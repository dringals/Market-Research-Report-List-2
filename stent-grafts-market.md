<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stent Grafts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AAA Stent Grafts</li><li>TAA Stent Grafts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stent grafts are medical devices used to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) and thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA). AAA stent grafts are specifically designed for treating aneurysms in the lower part of the aorta, located in the abdomen. On the other hand, TAA stent grafts are used to treat aneurysms in the upper part of the aorta, found in the chest. These stent grafts are inserted into the damaged artery, providing support and reinforcing the weakened area, ultimately preventing rupture and potentially fatal consequences.</p></p>

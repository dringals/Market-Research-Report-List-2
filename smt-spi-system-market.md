<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SMT-SPI System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-line SPI System</li><li>Off-line SPI System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In-line SPI systems are integrated directly into the production line, allowing for real-time inspection of solder paste deposits on PCBs. This type is ideal for high-volume, automated production environments. Off-line SPI systems, on the other hand, are standalone machines that are used for inspection outside of the production line. These systems are typically used for low-volume or prototype production, where a dedicated inspection station is needed. Both types of SPI systems offer high accuracy and efficiency in detecting defects in solder paste deposits.</p></p>

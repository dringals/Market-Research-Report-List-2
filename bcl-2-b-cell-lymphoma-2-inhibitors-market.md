<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Combination therapy</li><li>Monotherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>BCL-2 inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy used in the treatment of certain types of cancer, particularly B-cell lymphomas. The market for BCL-2 inhibitors can be categorized into two main types: combination therapy and monotherapy. Combination therapy refers to the use of BCL-2 inhibitors in combination with other drugs or treatment modalities, such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy. This approach aims to enhance the effectiveness of treatment by attacking the cancer from multiple angles. On the other hand, monotherapy refers to the use of BCL-2 inhibitors as a standalone treatment option, without combining them with other therapies. In certain cases, monotherapy may be sufficient to achieve tumor regression but it is often used in combination with other treatments to maximize patient outcomes.</p></p>

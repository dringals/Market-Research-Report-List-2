<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Band Reject Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tunable</li><li>Non-Tunable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Band reject filters, also known as notch filters or bandstop filters, are used in electronic devices to attenuate or reject specific frequency bands while allowing other frequencies to pass through. There are two main types of band reject filters available in the market: tunable and non-tunable. Tunable band reject filters can be adjusted to reject different frequency ranges, providing flexibility in various applications. On the other hand, non-tunable band reject filters have a fixed rejection frequency range, unable to be modified. Both types serve the purpose of eliminating unwanted frequencies, but differ in adjustability and scope of use.</p></p>

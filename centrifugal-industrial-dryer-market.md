<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Centrifugal Industrial Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct</li><li>Indirect</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centrifugal industrial dryers can be categorized into two types: direct and indirect. In the direct market, the dryer directly contacts the material to be dried, utilizing hot air or gases to remove moisture. This process is efficient and ideal for granular or coarse materials. On the other hand, in the indirect market, a heated surface transfers heat to the material, typically through conduction, avoiding direct contact with hot gases. This method is suitable for delicate or flammable materials, as it reduces the risk of product contamination or ignition.</p></p>

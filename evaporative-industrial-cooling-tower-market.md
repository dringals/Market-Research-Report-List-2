<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Evaporative Industrial Cooling Tower Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Cooling Tower</li><li>Closed Cooling Tower</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Evaporative Industrial Cooling Tower market consists of two main types: Open Cooling Towers and Closed Cooling Towers. Open Cooling Towers allow direct contact of hot water with atmospheric air, where a portion of water evaporates, cooling the remaining water. Closed Cooling Towers, on the other hand, separate the hot water from the atmosphere by using a heat exchanger. This allows for indirect cooling, eliminating the risk of contamination and reducing water loss due to evaporation. Both types serve the purpose of cooling industrial equipment and processes efficiently.</p></p>

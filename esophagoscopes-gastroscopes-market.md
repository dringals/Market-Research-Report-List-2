<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Esophagoscopes & Gastroscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Endoscope</li><li>Flexible Endoscope</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Esophagoscopes and gastroscopes are medical devices used to examine the esophagus and stomach, respectively. They come in two types: rigid endoscopes and flexible endoscopes. Rigid endoscopes are inflexible and provide a straight, direct view of the organs, requiring the patient to be under general anesthesia. Flexible endoscopes, on the other hand, are more versatile and can navigate through the curved and narrow passages without general anesthesia, making them more comfortable for patients. Both types play a crucial role in diagnosing and treating various gastrointestinal conditions.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Postive Pressure</li><li>Negative Pressure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pressure ventilators are devices used to provide mechanical ventilation to patients who are unable to breathe effectively on their own. Positive pressure ventilators deliver air or oxygen under pressure, forcing it into the lungs. This helps to expand the lungs and improve oxygenation. Negative pressure ventilators, on the other hand, create a vacuum around the chest, causing the chest to expand and air to be drawn into the lungs. Both types of ventilators aim to assist with breathing, but they achieve this in different ways â€“ one by pressurizing and the other by creating a vacuum.</p></p>

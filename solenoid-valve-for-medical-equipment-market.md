<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solenoid Valve for Medical Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Acting</li><li>Pilot Operated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solenoid valve for medical equipment market includes two main types: direct acting and pilot operated valves. Direct acting valves are simple and have a compact design, making them suitable for applications requiring low flow rates and low pressure differentials. They are controlled directly by the solenoid, which drives the valve's plunger to open or close the flow. On the other hand, pilot operated valves utilize a small pilot valve to control the flow through a larger main valve. This design allows for higher flow rates and pressure differentials.</p></p>

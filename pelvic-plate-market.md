<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pelvic Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Locking</li><li>Non-Locking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pelvic Plate market consists of two main types: Locking and Non-Locking plates. Locking plates are designed with specialized screws that provide a secure fixation, preventing movement between bone fragments and promoting faster healing. These plates are commonly used in complex fractures or cases requiring greater stability. On the other hand, Non-Locking plates do not have screws that lock into the plate, allowing more flexibility and adaptability during the surgical procedure. They are often used in less severe fractures or situations where additional movement may be necessary.</p></p>

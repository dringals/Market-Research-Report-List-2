<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Densitometer Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Bone Densitometry</li><li>Peripheral Bone Densitometry</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bone densitometer systems are used to measure the density of bones, determining the risk of osteoporosis and evaluating fracture risk. There are two types of bone densitometry systems: axial bone densitometry and peripheral bone densitometry. Axial bone densitometry measures the density of the spine and hip, providing a comprehensive assessment of bone health. Peripheral bone densitometry, on the other hand, measures the density of other bones like the wrist, heel, or finger, providing a less comprehensive but more accessible evaluation. Both systems are important in diagnosing and monitoring bone-related conditions.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Construction Core Drill Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Drill Bits</li><li>Dry Drill Bits</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Construction core drills are divided into two main market types based on the application method: wet drill bits and dry drill bits. Wet drill bits are designed to be used with water or other cooling agents to reduce heat and friction during drilling, ensuring a longer lifespan for the drill bit. Dry drill bits, on the other hand, do not require any additional fluids and are typically used for smaller, less intensive drilling projects. Both wet and dry drill bits cater to different construction needs and preferences.</p></p>

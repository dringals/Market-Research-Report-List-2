<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glass Breaking Infrared Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wired</li><li>Wireless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The glass breaking infrared detectors market consists of two main types: wired and wireless systems. Wired detectors are connected to the security system using physical cables, allowing for a reliable and stable connection. On the other hand, wireless detectors do not require physical cables and instead use wireless technology to communicate with the security system. This provides flexibility and easy installation, but may be less reliable in certain situations where there could be interference or limited signal range. Both types offer effective glass breaking detection capabilities, but with variations in connectivity and installation methods.</p></p>

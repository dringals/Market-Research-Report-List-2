<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Floating Offshore Wind Power Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spar-Buoy</li><li>Semi-submersible</li><li>Tension Leg Platform (TLP)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The floating offshore wind power market is categorized into different types of structures, namely Spar-Buoy, Semi-submersible, and Tension Leg Platform (TLP). Spar-Buoy is a tall cylindrical structure featuring a large buoy at the top and is anchored to the seabed. Semi-submersible structures are like floating platforms with submerged columns that provide stability. TLPs are moored to the seabed using taut vertical tendons, allowing them to float vertically while remaining stable. These three types of structures offer different solutions for harnessing wind power in offshore locations, catering to diverse environmental conditions and suitability for specific project requirements.</p></p>

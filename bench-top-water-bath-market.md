<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bench-top Water Bath Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Circulating Water Bath</li><li>Non-Circulating Water Bath</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The bench-top water bath market is divided into two types: circulating water bath and non-circulating water bath. A circulating water bath utilizes a pump to circulate the water within the bath, maintaining a uniform temperature throughout. It is commonly used for precise temperature control in scientific and research applications. On the other hand, a non-circulating water bath does not have a pump, and the water temperature is maintained by a heating element. Non-circulating water baths are often used in basic heating and general laboratory applications.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Organic Liquid Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Organic Liquid Photoresist Market consists of two main types: Positive Photoresist and Negative Photoresist. Positive Photoresist is a type of photoresist that becomes soluble when exposed to light, meaning that the parts of the resist that are exposed to light are removed during development. On the other hand, Negative Photoresist becomes insoluble when exposed to light, implying that the areas exposed to light remain after development. These two types offer different characteristics and are used in various applications within the electronics and semiconductor industries.</p></p>

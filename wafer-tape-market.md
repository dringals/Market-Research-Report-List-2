<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wafer Tape Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tape for Grinding</li><li>Tape for Dicing</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The wafer tape market consists of two main types: tape for grinding and tape for dicing. Tape for grinding is used during the process of semiconductor wafer back-grinding, where it protects the wafer's surface from damage. This tape helps to ensure a smooth and efficient grinding process. On the other hand, tape for dicing is utilized during the wafer dicing process, where it holds the individual chips in place after they have been separated from the wafer. This tape aids in protecting the chips from any potential damage during handling and transportation.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diamond Core Drilling Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Diamond Core Drilling Machines</li><li>Dry Diamond Core Drilling Machines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diamond core drilling machines are specialized equipment used for drilling holes in hard surfaces like concrete, rocks, or tiles. They are categorized into two types: wet diamond core drilling machines and dry diamond core drilling machines. Wet diamond core drilling machines use water for cooling and lubrication during the drilling process, reducing the chances of overheating and extending the lifespan of the drill bits. On the other hand, dry diamond core drilling machines do not require water and instead rely on air or vacuum systems to clear debris and cool the drill bits.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Hydraulic Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Acting Drive</li><li>Double Acting Drive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Aircraft hydraulic actuators have two main types, namely single-acting and double-acting drives. Single-acting drive actuators use hydraulic pressure to extend or retract the actuator piston in one direction, while a mechanical spring or external force returns it to the starting position. On the other hand, double-acting drive actuators can extend and retract the actuator piston in two directions using hydraulic pressure. This gives them more versatility and control in aircraft applications, allowing for a wider range of movements and functions.</p></p>

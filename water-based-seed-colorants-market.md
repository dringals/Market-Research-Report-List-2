<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water-Based Seed Colorants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dyes</li><li>Pigments</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Water-based seed colorants in the market are primarily divided into two types - dyes and pigments. Dyes are soluble colorants that penetrate the seed surface, imparting color through absorption. They are suitable for use on a variety of seeds and provide uniform coverage. On the other hand, pigments are insoluble particles that adhere to the seed surface, creating a protective barrier. Pigments are more suited for seeds that require a durable and long-lasting coating. Each type offers unique benefits and applications within the seed colorant market.</p></p>

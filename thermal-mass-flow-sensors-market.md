<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Mass Flow Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Thermal mass flow sensors are devices used to measure the flow rate of a fluid, usually gas. The market for these sensors can be classified into two types: contact type and non-contact type. </p><p>Contact type sensors involve direct physical contact with the fluid being measured. These sensors typically have a probe that comes into contact with the fluid, allowing for accurate measurements.</p><p>On the other hand, non-contact type sensors do not require physical contact with the fluid. Instead, they use advanced technologies such as ultrasonic or optical methods to measure the flow rate. These sensors are often favored in situations where avoiding contamination or blockage is crucial.</p></p>

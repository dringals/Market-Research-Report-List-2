<p><strong>The Oxacillin Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hospital</li><li>Drug Store</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oxacillin is commonly used in hospitals for treating infections caused by staphylococcus bacteria that are resistant to penicillin drugs. It falls under the penicillin antibiotic class and is effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Hospitals need oxacillin to combat the spread of these resistant bacteria. On the other hand, drug stores make oxacillin available for prescription use. This allows patients to access the medication for treating certain infections caused by penicillin-resistant staphylococcal bacteria. Thus, the hospital and drug store markets both rely on oxacillin to address resistant bacterial infections.</p></p>

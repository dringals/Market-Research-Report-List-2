<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bacteriophage Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oral</li><li>Topical</li><li>Parenteral</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bacteriophage therapy is an emerging field that involves using viruses called bacteriophages to treat bacterial infections. The therapy can be administered through different routes, including oral, topical, and parenteral methods. Oral bacteriophage therapy involves ingesting phage formulations, which can target infections in the gastrointestinal tract. Topical therapy applies phage preparations directly on the skin to treat localized infections, such as wounds or burns. Parenteral therapy requires injecting phages directly into the bloodstream or specific body tissues to treat systemic infections. These different administration methods allow for tailored treatment approaches depending on the nature and location of the infection.</p></p>

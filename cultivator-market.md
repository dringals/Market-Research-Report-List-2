<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cultivator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Models</li><li>Hydraulic Folding</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The cultivator market is categorized into three main types: rigid models, hydraulic folding, and others. Rigid models refer to cultivators that have a fixed frame and cannot be folded. They are generally cheaper and suitable for smaller farming operations. Hydraulic folding cultivators, on the other hand, have a frame that can be folded, making them easier to transport and store. This type is preferred by larger farming operations. The "others" category includes cultivators with unique features or designs that don't fall under the previous two types.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spiral Screens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical</li><li>Inclined</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Spiral screens are classified into two primary market types based on their orientation: vertical and inclined. Vertical spiral screens are designed to be installed in a vertical position, allowing materials to flow vertically through the screen. They are commonly used in industries such as mining, food processing, and waste management. In contrast, inclined spiral screens are installed at an angle, enabling materials to flow diagonally across the screen. These screens are often used in applications where gravity is utilized to separate and classify materials, such as in mineral processing and aggregates industries.</p></p>

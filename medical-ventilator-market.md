<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Invasive Medical Ventilator</li><li>Invasive Medical Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical ventilator market consists of two main types: non-invasive medical ventilators and invasive medical ventilators. Non-invasive medical ventilators help patients breathe by delivering air through a mask or nasal prongs, without the need for inserting a tube into the windpipe. Invasive medical ventilators, on the other hand, require the insertion of a tube into the patient's windpipe to provide ventilation support. Both types play a crucial role in assisting patients with compromised respiratory functions and can be used in various healthcare settings.</p></p>

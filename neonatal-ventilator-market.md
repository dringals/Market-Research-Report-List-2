<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neonatal Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neonatal ventilators are devices used to assist newborns in breathing. There are two main types of neonatal ventilators: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilators involve the insertion of a tube into the respiratory system, providing mechanical breaths directly to the lungs. Non-invasive ventilators deliver support through a mask or nasal prongs, bypassing the need for intubation. Both types of ventilators play a crucial role in providing respiratory support to neonates with breathing difficulties, with the choice between invasive and non-invasive depending on the individual patient's needs.</p></p>

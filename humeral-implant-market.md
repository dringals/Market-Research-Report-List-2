<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Humeral Implant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Implants</li><li>Variable Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The humeral implant market includes two types: fixed implants and variable implants. Fixed implants are designed to provide a stable and rigid fixation of the humerus bone. These implants are commonly used in cases when there is a significant loss of bone or in complex fractures. On the other hand, variable implants offer flexibility in terms of adjustment and alignment. They allow the surgeon to customize the implant's position and angle, optimizing the functional outcome for each patient. Variable implants are often used in less severe fractures or cases where the bone quality is better.</p></p>
